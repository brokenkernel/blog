      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Annotated Turing&amp;rdquo; by Charles Petzold 1
Many of us have learned about &amp;lsquo;Turing Machines&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Turing Completeness&amp;rsquo; but have never actually read the motivating text and explanation. This is a phenomenal book that goes through paragraph by paragraph the paper &amp;ldquo;On Computable Numbers&amp;rdquo; 2 by Alan Turing in a rigorous way explaining the concept intuitively and completely. Not only does it explain the text but it also gives enough background so that one could understand and follow through the proofs themselves.</description>

      <description>I recently read &amp;ldquo;The leprechauns of software engineering&amp;rdquo; by Laurent Bossavit 1. The book goes through a few myths about software engineering and then traces how those myths entered the public consciousness. It was well worth reading for anyone interested in research based software engineering practices. It was primarily useful on how to verify about claims rather than the claims themselves. While I&amp;rsquo;ve heard of most of the myths - I also heard about them as myths rather than as true claims.</description>
