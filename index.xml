      <description>One habbit I&amp;rsquo;ve started at work is called &amp;ldquo;slack to wiki&amp;rdquo;. Whenever I learn something new, or explain something to someone else, I try to document it on our internal wiki quickly and in a low effort way. If I come back to the topic again in the future I&amp;rsquo;ll modify the content and make it actully good.
This forms of a knoledge base which can grow, and also lets me reference past topics in future conversations more easily.</description>

      <title>Modulo and Remainder</title>

      <description>This is a quick test blog post to see if I could make mathjax and such work for me. It is not supposed to be complete right now.
Some Definitions  even a number is even there is no remainder when dividied by 2 equivalently $\{ 2k: k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$
 odd a number is odd if it is not even equivelently $\{ 2k+1: k \in \mathbb{Z} \}$
  This leads to the obvious question of what is a remainder?</description>
