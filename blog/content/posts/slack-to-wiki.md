One habbit I've started at work is called "slack to wiki".
Whenever I learn something new, or explain something to someone else,
I try to document it on our internal wiki quickly and in a low effort way.
If I come back to the topic again in the future I'll modify the content and make it actully good.

This forms of a knowledge base which can grow, and also lets me reference past topics in future conversations more
 easily.

I'm hoping this website could become more of that in a somewhat more public way.
